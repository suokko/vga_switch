vga_switch is a hack helper tool to work around missing driver functionality.
Code is purely written for a hybrid graphics system with always shared display
connection through IGD (intel-radeon).

It might be useful for someone else with similar system but be careful that code
may not work on your system with completely different paths and/or tools. Please
first check that all hard coded paths and tools exists. Most likely candidate of
problems seems to be update-rc.d script name and debugfs mounting.

** Build **

Only dependency is c compiler and unix c library. Runtime dependecies are linux
debugfs with vgaswitcheroo support and xrandr 1.4 with xserver 2.13.

make
make install

** Usage **

vga_switch can be used to switch between cards and mange power of secondary
card as normal user. It also provides nice hook to systemd and pm util sleep
functions to avoid card wakeup bug in kernel.

vga_switch -i
vga_switch -d
vga_switch -s off
vga_switch -s on
vga_switch

vga_prime takes one number as paramatere defining the card to run with and after
that command to run. It user vga_switch internaly to power on and off secondary
card automatically based on mmaped reference count file.

vga_prime 1 glxinfo
vga_prime 0 glxgears -info

** Components **

/sbin/vga_switch

The hack setuid binary. It may break your system with sys admin capability.

/usr/bin/vga_prime

Very minimal wrapper tool to run as user to set VGA_PRIME environment variable
and power on secondary CPU on demand.

/etc/X11/Xsession.d/98vga_switch_hack

Automatic setup that is required to keep intel on when starting X with discreet
card as primary. It also setups offload connection between cards when intel is
primary.

/etc/init.d/vga_switch

Early boot switch making sure swithc to discreet card happens before Xorg starts.

/etc/pm/sleep.d/vga

pm utils hack script to make sure that radeon is powered on before suspend to
avoid it locking up.

/lib/systemd/system-sleep/vga.sh

Same as above for systemd configuration.

/etc/vga_switch.conf

Simple config to select card during boot.
