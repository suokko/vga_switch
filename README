vga_switch is a hack helper tool to work around missing driver functionality.
Code is purely written for a hybrid graphics system with always shared display
connection through IGD (intel-radeon).

It might be useful for someone else with similar system but be careful that code
may not work on your system with completely different paths and/or tools. Please
first check that all hard coded paths and tools exists. Most likely candidate of
problems seems to be update-rc.d script name and debugfs mounting.
